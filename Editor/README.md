# Style Browser

Style Browser is an easy to use Editor Window that allows you to view all of the built in styles and textures that Unity has built into it. Simply right click and the item will be copied to your clipboard.

### Credit 

Style Browser was originally designed to replace the open source [BuiltInResourcesWindow](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Show_Built_In_Resources) on the Unity Wiki. This script I found super helpful but it was not really well written. So I expanded upon it. 

### TODO:
* Add loader for textures
